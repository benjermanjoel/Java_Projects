<h2>My Biography</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Ben Julian and I'm a technical support engineer at a software company here in Eau Claire called Jamf. When I'm not busy troubleshooting software issues or tinkering with Macs, I like to be outside with my family or curled up on the couch with a book. I also enjoy bird-watching, video games, and board games.</p>
